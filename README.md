# Python-Programming-Project-2022

As apart of the Year 2 curriculum in Nanyang Polytechnic, under the module Data Structures & Algorithms, I created a Customer Booking System for a Hotel.

The purpose of my system is to allow a hotel to manage its customer booking records for the packages offered. My project is able to display and update staycation booking records from the system and allow the administrator using it to perform searching (using Linear Search and Binary Search) and sorting of records (using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort).
